# Color-Extraction

In this repo, we are finding the dominant color from the sample image or given image using the K-Means algorithm.
At first we take the image and crop the major part of the image and the we used the K-Means algorithm which we have created from scratch and then we extract the dominant color from the image and then uses those color only to again color the image.

### Libraries Used :-
